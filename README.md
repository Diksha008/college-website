This is a Frontend college-website
This is a Frontend college website. (Version-1) You have contacted me asking me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is usually yes, with attribution. I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, plagiarism is bad. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.
